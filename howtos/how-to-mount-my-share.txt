# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# target (mountpoint)
# source (device)


# -----------
# On the host:
# -----------
# In Oracle VM Virtualbox Manager, verify in settings 
# which <network adapter name> is used to connect to the host.

# In cygwin terminal, determine ip address of host that the VM sees.
    ipconfig | grep -A7 "<network adapter name> Network:" |grep IPv4

# Create a folder at C:\\<shared_dir_name>

# Share new folder using Windows Explorer

# Change folder properties (Sharing tab and Security tab)


# ---------
# On the VM:
# ---------
    su -        # do this all as root

# Install packages on remote
    yum list installed |grep samba
    yum list installed |grep cifs
    #OR...
    #yum list installed samba
    #yum list installed cifs

    yum install samba-client samba-common cifs-utils 

# Create a mount point
    mkdir /mnt/<mount_dir>

# Mount the share using the CIFS util
# CAUTION: DO NOT CD TO THE MOUNT POINT BEFORE MOUNTING THE DEVICE
mount -t cifs xxx.xxx.x.xxx//<shared_dir_name> /mnt/<mount_dir> -o user=<username>
# Enter windows password for <username>

# See the content of source on the mount point
ls /mnt/<mount_dir> 

# UNMOUNT WHEN DONE
umount /mnt/<mount_dir>
